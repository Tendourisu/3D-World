## how to build the program
1. use `mkdir -p build` to make the "build" file.
2. use `g++ -std=c++14 $(find . -name "*.cpp" -print) -o build/main` on your console to build the program.
3. use `./build/main` to run the program.
4. write down the path of the ".obj" file (like `./Data/cube.obj`) to import the model.
5. use `help` to get the command you want.
